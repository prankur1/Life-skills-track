## Which point(s) were new to you?
<br>
The points given in the stuck? Ask questions section are very informative and new to me, like we can use codepen, codesandbox to share the code and get help when stuck.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
<br>
I need to improve on the part of communication, when interacting with others. For e.g. to explain problem clearly, etc.
<br>
Also, I will try to add exercise as a part of my daily routine that will help to keep my energy levels high throughout the day.
